# 📄 Hello everybody 🫦🧟‍♂️

### 🔳 I am known by many names 
    Watson | LLIK-LLA | Erasmus

### 🔲 I am trying my best to teach myself how to develop programs. Mostly likely Game development but I am not only interested in making games. In fact I find that I am at least some what interested in <i>almost</i> all the facets of modern programming. It has been a constant struggle to find the focus to keep making progress in teaching myself to program. But one thing I will never do is give up.

 ### 🔳 Also I am very interested in **Android App Development** in particular
 - as well as the **Termux** 📱 application & all of its wonderful possiblities.
