### Hello everybody ðŸ«¥

â­• I am know by many names :
    Watson | LLIK-LLA | Erasmus

I am trying my best to teach my self how to develop programs. Mostly likely Game development but I am not only interested in making games. I find that I am at least some what interested in almost all the facets of modern programming. It has been a struggle to find the focus to keep making progress in my self taught situation. But there have been a few milestones and fun projects.
