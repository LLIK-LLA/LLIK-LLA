### 🔳 I am known by many names 
    Watson | LLIK-LLA | Erasmus | X|85

### 🔲 I am trying my best to teach myself how to develop programs. I am most interested in game development but games are not my only interest. In fact, I find myself exploring <i>almost</i> every category of modern programming with equal enthusiasm.
  Although I will admit it has been an almost constant struggle to will myself to focus long enough on any subject to completely learn its fundamentals well enough for me to put them to practice on my own ideas & projects. But one thing I know I will never allow myself to do is give up! I will day by day learn a little more each and everyday till my 🥅 goals are attained.

 ### 🔳 Also I am particularly interested in **Android App Development**.
 - as well as **Termux** 📱 the android terminal shell, & all of its wonderful possiblities.
